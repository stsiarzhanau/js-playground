# js-playground

transpiler, test environment, linter

## Prerequisites

You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Optionally you can install and use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager, but it's possible to use **npm** instead, which ships with **Node.js**.


## Installation

- Clone this repo with **`git clone https://github.com/stsiarzhanau/js-playground`** or (if you don't use Git) just click on the green **Clone or download** button and then on **Download ZIP**
- Unzip downloaded file (if you have used 2nd option)
- Open terminal and [go to the project's root folder](http://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt)  (**js-playground**)
- Run **`yarn install`** (or **`npm install`**) to install project dependencies

## Usage

- Run **`yarn test`** (or **`npm test -s`**) to run unit tests in watch mode

  > *NOTE: The `-s` flag is optional. It enables silent mode, which suppresses unnecessary messages from npm, and so we get cleaner output.*
